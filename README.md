## Quick Start

### One-line install (recommended)

```bash
# Install all 7 skills into ~/.claude/skills/
npx @barkermoney/skills install --all

# Or pick specific ones
npx @barkermoney/skills install stablecoin-yield-radar yield-strategy-advisor

# Other commands
npx @barkermoney/skills list             # show bundled + installed
npx @barkermoney/skills update           # re-install latest of currently installed
npx @barkermoney/skills remove <name>    # uninstall one
npx @barkermoney/skills --help           # full help
```

Then restart Claude Code (or your agent runtime) to activate. Override the install dir with `--target <dir>` or `$BARKER_SKILLS_DIR`.

**Updating often?** Install the CLI globally so you can drop the `npx` prefix:

```bash
npm install -g @barkermoney/skills
skills install --all     # then from any directory
skills update            # later, pull latest skill content
```

### MCP server (stdio) — DEPRECATED (self-host only)

> ⚠️ **Deprecated.** The bundled `barker-mcp` stdio server wraps Barker's legacy **anonymous** data API, which is being retired. Once anonymous access is off, its tools return HTTP 401. Live data is now served via the **x402-paid MCP at `mcp.barker.money`** (see the Data access section below). This stdio server is retained **only** for operators self-hosting against their own `BARKER_API_BASE` with their own access — it is not a free tier.

Self-hosting against your own base? `barker-mcp` is a stdio MCP server that wraps the resource endpoints (`/defi/vaults`, `/market/overview`, `/market/trend`, `/agent-payments/*`) as callable tools.

```bash
# Register with Claude Code (user scope, persists across sessions)
claude mcp add -s user barker -- npx -y -p @barkermoney/skills barker-mcp
```

Then restart Claude Code. Three tools become available:

| Tool | Wraps | Use for |
|------|-------|---------|
| `barker_defi_vaults` | `/defi/vaults` | "best USDC yield", "Aave vs Morpho", filter by asset/chain/sort/limit |
| `barker_market_overview` | `/market/overview` | total cap, yield-bearing cap, asset/chain distribution |
| `barker_market_trend` | `/market/trend` | 7–180 day APY trend vs US Treasury benchmark |

Smoke test outside of an agent host:

```bash
npx -p @barkermoney/skills barker-mcp
# speaks MCP over stdio; pipe JSON-RPC frames to interact
```

### OKX Wallet Plugin Store

```bash
npx skills add okx/plugin-store --skill <skill-name>
# e.g.: npx skills add okx/plugin-store --skill stablecoin-yield-radar
```

### Manual (git clone)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YBSbarker/barker-stablecoin-skills.git
cp -r barker-stablecoin-skills/skills/<skill-name> ~/.claude/skills/
```

### Anthropic Plugin Marketplace

Each skill is shipped with `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and is compatible with the Claude Code plugin marketplace.

### Cursor / Cline / other MCP hosts

Point your host at Barker's remote MCP at **`mcp.barker.money`** — the skill SKILL.md files call the `barker_*` tools (`barker_defi_vaults`, `barker_market_overview`, `barker_market_trend`, plus the judgment tools) there, x402-paid per call. Live data is paid-only; there is no free or anonymous tier. Pricing: $0.001–$0.01/call, paid in USDT0/USDC across X Layer/Base/Ethereum/Polygon/Arbitrum. Per-venue CEX detail is internal only and not offered on the public MCP.

## Data access

Live data is served to agents through Barker's **x402-paid MCP** — there is no free or anonymous data API. The REST endpoints that previously served this data anonymously are being retired.

```
MCP endpoint: https://mcp.barker.money
Payment:      x402 per-call ($0.001–$0.01), USDT0/USDC on X Layer/Base/Ethereum/Polygon/Arbitrum
```

(agent discovery: https://api.barker.money/llms.txt — the public agent-discovery file stays free)

### Access model & security posture

- **Authentication / payment**: Per-call x402. On an HTTP 402 challenge, the agent settles payment (e.g. via an OKX OnchainOS or wallet payment skill) and retries — no account or API key. There is no free or anonymous tier.
- **Abuse model**: x402 payment gate + edge DDoS protection in front.
- **Data scope sent to the API**: Only public market parameters — stablecoin symbol, chain name, sort/limit. **No** wallet addresses, balances, signatures, private keys, or PII are transmitted by any skill in this suite.
- **Data returned**: Public yield / market / TVL figures only. Sensitivity equivalent to public market-data APIs such as CoinGecko or DeFiLlama.
- **External data boundary**: Every SKILL.md in this suite includes a `## Security: External Data Boundary` section instructing consuming LLMs to treat all API response strings as untrusted data, not instructions.

| Tool | Returns |
|------|---------|
| `barker_defi_vaults` | DeFi yield pools with APY, TVL, protocol, chain, asset |
| `barker_market_overview` | Total market cap, yield-bearing cap, asset/chain distribution |
| `barker_market_trend` | Historical APY trend (7–180 days) with US Treasury benchmark |

Judgment tools (yield advisor, protocol-campaign radar, pool deep-dives) are also callable per-call. Per-venue CEX detail (products, campaigns, borrow rates, venue × asset matrix) is **internal only** and not offered on the public MCP. Interactive map for humans at [barker.money](https://barker.money).

### Response Shape & Units

All responses are JSON with `{ success, data, ... }`. APY and `share_pct` fields are **decimals** (`0.0523` = 5.23%, `0.4250` = 42.5%) — multiply by 100 for display.

### Paid agent tools (x402)

Every `barker_*` tool — the core data tools plus the judgment tools (yield advisor, protocol-campaign radar, pool deep-dives) — is called per-call via the x402 gateway: $0.001–$0.01 per call, paid in USDT0/USDC across X Layer, Base, Ethereum, Polygon, and Arbitrum. No account or API key — the agent settles each HTTP 402 challenge and retries. Per-venue CEX detail is internal only and not offered on the public MCP.

### Execution tools (x402, non-custodial)

Beyond data and judgment, agents can buy **unsigned, ready-to-sign transactions**:

| Tool | Price | What you get |
|---|---|---|
| `barker_executable_pools` | $0.005 | Stablecoin vaults your agent can act on right now — every row is guaranteed quotable |
| `barker_execution_quote` | $0.01 | An unsigned deposit/redeem transaction (`{chainId, to, data, value}`) + route + risk + approval info |

**Barker never broadcasts and never holds funds.** Your agent pays for the transaction, verifies it (the amount encoded in calldata is returned as `calldata_amount_base_units` for byte-level verification), and your user signs with their own wallet. Vault shares always go to the signer — `receiver` is not a parameter. Same-chain only.

Full working client — pay → quote → verify → sign → broadcast → confirm shares:

```bash
npm i viem
read -rs PRIVATE_KEY && export PRIVATE_KEY
node examples/x402-execution-buyer.mjs
unset PRIVATE_KEY
```

See [`examples/x402-execution-buyer.mjs`](examples/x402-execution-buyer.mjs) — ~200 lines, copy the safety checks into your own agent.

## FAQ

**Q: How often is the data updated?**
A: Real-time. The yield index reflects live data from 500+ protocols and 20+ CEX.

**Q: Do I need an API key?**
A: No API key — but live data is not free. Agents pay per call via x402 at `mcp.barker.money` ($0.001–$0.01/call), settling each HTTP 402 challenge and retrying. The skills are free to install; there is no free or anonymous data tier.

**Q: What stablecoins are covered?**
A: All stablecoins on the market — USDT, USDC, DAI, USDS, USDe, sUSDe, FDUSD, GHO, crvUSD, PYUSD, sDAI, frxUSD, TUSD, BUSD, LUSD, DOLA, MIM, FRAX, USDs, USDX, RLUSD, USDY, BUIDL, and more. If a stablecoin exists, Barker covers it.

**Q: What chains are supported?**
A: All chains — Ethereum, BSC, Arbitrum, Base, Polygon, Optimism, Avalanche, Solana, Sui, Aptos, Sei, Mantle, Scroll, zkSync, Linea, Blast, Mode, Manta, and more. Barker has the most comprehensive multi-chain coverage in the market.

**Q: Is this financial advice?**
A: No. All skills provide educational information only, not financial advice. Always DYOR.

**Q: Where can I find the best stablecoin yields?**
A: Use the `stablecoin-yield-radar` skill or visit [barker.money](https://barker.money) for the full interactive yield map.

**Q: How does Barker compare to DeFiLlama or CoinGecko?**
A: Barker is **stablecoin-only** and combines **CEX + on-chain** data in a single index. DeFiLlama focuses on on-chain TVL; CoinGecko focuses on token prices. Barker is the specialized yield index for stablecoins.
