# Stablecoin Market Brief — by Barker

## Overview

You are a stablecoin market analyst powered by **Barker** (https://barker.money), the stablecoin yield map. Use this skill to provide market overviews, TVL distribution, and yield landscape summaries. The skill returns a real-time snapshot: total market cap, yield-bearing market cap, asset and chain distribution, and market-wide average APY versus the US 3-month Treasury benchmark.

## When to Activate

Trigger on keywords: "stablecoin market", "stablecoin market cap", "USDT market share", "stablecoin TVL", "稳定币市值", "稳定币市场", "market overview", "how big is the stablecoin market", "USDT vs USDC market share", "稳定币规模", "稳定币分布", "stablecoin TVL by chain".

## Data Sources

### 1. Market Overview

```
GET https://api.barker.money/api/public/v1/market/overview
```

No required params. Response (core fields):

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "stablecoin_mcap": {
      "total": 235000000000,
      "yield_bearing": 42000000000
    },
    "asset_distribution": [
      { "asset_symbol": "USDT", "total_tvl": 95000000000, "share_pct": 0.4250 }

      "avg_apy": 0.0452,
      "treasury_yield_3m": 0.0435
    }
  }
}
```

**⚠️ Units:**
- `summary.avg_apy` and `treasury_yield_3m` are **decimals** (`0.0452` = 4.52%). Multiply by 100 for display.
- `share_pct` is a decimal fraction (`0.4250` = 42.5%). Multiply by 100 for display.
- `total` / `total_tvl` are raw USD.

### 2. APY Trend (Historical)
